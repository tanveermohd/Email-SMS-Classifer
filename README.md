# ðŸ“§ Email & SMS Spam Classifier
A Machine Learning project to classify Email and SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Legitimate) using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

ðŸš€ Project Overview

Spam messages are a growing challenge in communication, often used for phishing or scams.
Traditional keyword-based or rule-based filters cannot keep up with evolving spam patterns.

This project develops a robust ML-powered spam detection system with 99% accuracy using Multinomial Naive Bayes, making it scalable for real-world applications.
