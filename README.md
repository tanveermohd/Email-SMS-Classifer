# 📧 Email & SMS Spam Classifier
A Machine Learning project to classify Email and SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Legitimate) using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

### 🚀 Project Overview
Spam messages are a growing challenge in communication, often used for phishing or scams.
Traditional keyword-based or rule-based filters cannot keep up with evolving spam patterns.

This project develops a robust ML-powered spam detection system with 99% accuracy using Multinomial Naive Bayes, making it scalable for real-world applications.

### 🛠 Problem Statement
-Spam causes loss of productivity and exposes users to security risks.
-Rule-based methods fail because spammers constantly change tactics.
-Goal: Build a machine learning classifier that automatically identifies spam with high accuracy, precision, and recall.

### 🔑 Solution Approach
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
Cleaned and normalized text.
Removed stopwords, tokenized, applied stemming.
Converted text to numerical features with Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.
#### 2. Model Training & Evaluation
Trained Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes.
Multinomial Naive Bayes outperformed others.
#### 3. Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: 99%
Precision: 0.98 (minimizing false positives)
Recall: 0.99 (catching nearly all spam)

### 📊 Key Results
Dataset size: ~10,000 labeled messages (spam & ham).
Training Accuracy: 99%
Test Accuracy: 95–97%
Prediction Speed: < 50ms per message → suitable for real-time spam detection.

### 🧰 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk
Algorithms: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

### 🚧 Future Improvements
Deploy as a REST API (Flask/FastAPI).
Build an interactive Streamlit/Gradio app.
Explore Deep Learning (LSTM, Transformers, BERT).
Integration with real email/SMS platforms for live filtering.

### 🎯 Impact
Filters out ~99% of spam messages, improving productivity.
Strengthens security by catching phishing attempts.
Can scale to enterprise-level email/SMS filtering systems.
